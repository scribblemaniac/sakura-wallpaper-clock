![Wallpaper Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

This is a wallpaper clock featuring a high quality picture of cherry trees blossoming over a relfective lake. If you are not familiar with wallpaper clocks, they are wallpapers that display the date and time in addition to serving as a beautiful backdrop for your computer.

## Installation

First, you will need to install a program to open .wcz files. Some of these programs are listed [here](You will also need to install a program http://www.vladstudio.com/wallpaperclocks/), but there are additional ones you can find if you search for it.

Now if you just want to install this wallpaper, head to the [releases](https://github.com/scribblemaniac/sakura-wallpaper-clock/releases) section, and find a .wcz file to download (the latest version is usually the best). Then all you need to do is open that file up with the program you installed in the previous section.

## Development

If you wish, you can modify the wallpaper clock to your liking. To do that, download this repository and make whatever changes you desire in the Source folder. Documentation on the file format can be found [here](http://www.vladstudio.com/wallpaperclock_create/). We recommend you read it before making changes so you better understand how the format works. When you are ready to test or share your wallpaper clock, compress the Source folder into a zip file format, and rename the Source.zip to Source.wcz. You should be able to open that file with any program that supports the wcz format. The code is under the MIT license, so do whatever you want with it. If you think other people would find your changes useful, we would really appreciate it if you made a pull request with your changes.
